## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 215, 80%, 50% (approximately #1A75FF) for a reliable, trustworthy, and technologically advanced feeling.
- Background color: HSL 215, 20%, 95% (approximately #F0F4FF) for a clean, neutral background.
- Accent color: HSL 185, 70%, 50% (approximately #1AB8B8) to give important components and CTAs great contrast against the primary and background colors.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Simple, geometric icons to represent data types, file formats, and actions. Use a consistent style throughout the app.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear separation of sections. Use a grid-based system for responsive design.
- Subtle animations for transitions and feedback. Avoid excessive animations that could distract users.
